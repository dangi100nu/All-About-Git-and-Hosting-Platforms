### Version Control Systems (VCS)

- **Git**: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is open-source and the most widely used VCS.
- **Mercurial**: Another distributed version control system similar to Git, but with a simpler user interface. Not as popular as Git but still used in some organizations.

### Git Repository Hosting Services

- **GitHub**: A cloud-based service for hosting Git repositories with additional collaboration features like pull requests, issues, actions, project boards, and GitHub pages. It’s heavily used for open-source projects.
- **GitLab**: A web-based Git repository manager offering features like integrated CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, code review, and more. GitLab can be self-hosted or used as a cloud service.
- **Bitbucket**: A Git-based repository service by Atlassian, known for tight integration with other Atlassian tools like Jira and Trello. Bitbucket offers both Git and Mercurial support and is widely used for private repositories.
- **Azure Repos**: Part of Azure DevOps, it provides Git repository hosting along with other Azure DevOps services like continuous integration, testing, and project management.
- **AWS CodeCommit**: A fully managed source control service hosted on AWS that supports Git repositories. It offers high availability, security, and scalability for teams using Amazon Web Services.
